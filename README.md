# NutriFinder
Android Mobile Application built as my final year Unversity Project. The main objective of this app is to take a picture of any food items and recognize as what food it is using Image classifier.
After recognising the food item, it will give you the "nutritional facts" in reponse to the picture it identified. The app uses Clarifai API for the
image identification. It uses Nutritionix API for all the nutrational facts displayed in the application.
